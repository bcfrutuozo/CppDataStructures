# CppDataStructures

## Overview
This repository is a education purpose of open-source implementation of a variety of algorithms implemented in C++ and licensed under MIT License.
It also feature functions that are not implemented in the default STL library. However, as it is for education, it was never mean to be compared with STL.
So its suggested that this repository is NEVER used in large projects. Always use the STL library for these cases.

## Features
* Implementations of most common algorithms in one of the most fundamental general purpose languages - C++;
* Test cases using catch2 for each one of the algorithms;
* Source compiled for Linux and Windows (for Visual Studio will be implemented using _CrtDumpMemoryLeaks() to check for memory leaks);
